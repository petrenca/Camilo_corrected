You will be presented a series of straightforward statements that we would
like you to evaluate as <i> True </i> or <i> False </i>. The statements concern categorizations,
such as <i> All socks are clothes </i>. Each statement will scroll out — one word at a time,
like words on a page — and the relevant keys for answering are D (for True) and K
(for False). Note that it is important to us that you answer in a timely fashion. That
is, while you are not pressured to answer fast we are seeking your immediate
reactions.
