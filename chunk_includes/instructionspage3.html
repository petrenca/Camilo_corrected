With response efficiency in mind, we would like for you to keep each of your index
fingers poised above those two keys (the D and the K on an QWERTY keyboard)
and with your thumbs poised above the spacebar. You will need to hit the spacebar
(with whichever thumb) to move on to the next trial. Here is a picture of the way we
would like for you to keep your hands poised as you go through the task. It is very
important to maintain this position throughout.
